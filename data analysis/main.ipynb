      "The text describes a structured morning routine focused on physical and mental preparation. The individual wakes up around 5 to 5:30 AM and begins with a 12-mile run, which serves as a form of mental armor against the challenges of the day. After running, they eat a small meal and head to the gym, incorporating stretching and meditation into their routine. The speaker emphasizes the importance of building confidence through tangible accomplishments rather than relying on affirmations. They argue that true self-esteem comes from hard work and overcoming challenges, rather than merely dreaming about success. The discussion highlights the need for discipline, planning, and a proactive approach to achieving goals, warning against the pitfalls of merely talking about ambitions without taking action.\n"
