been like that forseven years but going back to what yousaid before about needing to cap successyou wouldn't be able to fit well evenone tenth of that in exactly if you werechasing down exactly yep that's exactlyit so if all that's [ __ ] up that's whyI got a cap success because I can't putthat in do and and that's my growthfactorso you know that's that's my humangrowth factor you said before aboutum how you build up self-esteem andconfidence and stuff and there's thisquote from one of my friends Alex homozythat says you don't become Confident byshouting affirmations in the mirror butby having a stack of undeniable proofthat you are who you say you are outworkyourself doubt yesthat's that's nailed nailed completelynailed yes because a lot of people willin some of these motivational people outhere is the funniest thing in the worldto me they'll go and say when you wakeup in the morning pound your chest youknow [ __ ] look at yourself in themirror and do all this [ __ ] [ __ ]I hope it workswhat works for me is that everydayresume the things I know of accomplishedthe things I know I've done real hardwork the real calluses on my mind thereal calluses on my hands that's that'sit the you don't need to pound yourchest in the mirror to [ __ ] anymore ifyou have that it seems like especiallywith confidence right or self-esteemthere's a relationship betweenconfidence and competence so what you'relooking to do is try and have what youbelieve that you can do be ahead of whatyou can do right you're not looking forit to be delusional you don't want it toto be able to believe that you can dosomething like fly right but you need tohave a relationship between the two butwhat people are asking for is for theirconfidence to be so far ahead of theircompetence that or without having evenbeen competent to anything in thebeginning and that's just delusionthat's fantasy right well I believe thatyou have to build beliefbelief is like there's an after-schoolspecial belief where the mom saysbelieve in yourself and that's all greatbut there's also a built beliefand the built belief is one where youare constantly like for me I came from abad place How I build belief is throughthe the daunting tasksI put myself through so that's proofpositive that I canso it correlates and that's how thispiece of [ __ ] kid I once thought I wasdon't believe by saying hmmI was in three hell weeks I went toRanger school I tried out for Deltaselection undeniable stack of proof thatis proof [ __ ] so whenever youthink whenever you think you can'tconfidence comes from the thing that youbuiltyou must build belief you must buildconfidence it can be like heyum I'm Gonna Knock that [ __ ] outyou gotta look over here and sayI can knock that [ __ ] outis belief and it's built on what you putin to yourself another friend sent me amessage this morning knowing that we hadthis this big thing that we've beenworking toward for a long time today hesaid uh Nietzsche said I know of nobetter life purpose than to perish inattempting the great and impossible thefact that something seems impossibleshouldn't be a reason to not pursue itthat's exactly what makes it worthpursuing where would the courage andgreatness be if success was certain andthere was no risk the only true failureis shrinking away from life's challengesyou know that one also two for two nothat one also man yeah it's that umit's not dealing with laziness andself-doubt thing I think uhand I do wonder how many people use thelook in the mirror pound the chest stareinto your eyes say your affirmationsdon't get the results and then loseconfidencewell that's part of it a lot of it islimited Horizonslimited Horizons are like I use me as anexample alwaysI came froma small town in Indianawhere there was a handful of blackfamiliesanda lot of people in that town when youcome from a town of 8 000 peopleit's like we had a local plantGreat Dane and like you know what Iwannawork at

smallcompartmentand one thing I was able to do was todreammany people but don't make dreams your[ __ ] masterbut I was able to dream outside those[ __ ] Four Walls of that small townand until you're able to really putyourself into that dream but don't makedreams your master that's where youtruly become what you're destined tobecome what you mean don't make dreamsyour master a lot of people sit back andthey dream about beinga sports figure or dream about being aseal or dream about being an astronautand all it is is a [ __ ] dreamthey don't put the work behind the dreamthat dream has become their [ __ ]masterwhen you become the master of your[ __ ] dream is when you say I want togo be a Navy SEAL and you say okay I'mgonna lose 106 pounds in less than three[ __ ] monthsthe dream was the
